* Data about plagiarism is stored in a separate DB table: Plagiarism_task, Plagiarism_project. In order to decrease time consuming while making overall calculations.
* Together with Ui/Ux designer we decided that statistics will be on the students' side. Statistics data will show to what extend the class is achieved, how was the overall experience of a student. 
* Together with backend developer we decided also to present info regardig plagiarism statistics on each task and project. So that students could also evaluate their own job and see level of uniqueness of their work. 
* New features: motivational citates to cheer up students and timer to boost their productivity.
