* Choosen optimal way: Project category would better be defined by the priority student gave it. There was an alternative to categorize them by the level of completeness, but from accuracy and usability, as I decided this way is fine drawn. 
* To ease prioritizing tasks/projects for students, we will add labelled bonuses and mission of the task. So that, students see bonuses label clearly and choose rapidly what he needs to start ASAP.   
* Review data for statistics and finally indicate type of datas we would better use for statistics to developers.
