It's all about what you can do for your country for your own benefit and for the benefit of unborn generations!‚Äù as Israelmore Ayivor said, this is the phrase that forced us to create a platform for the favor of our country's young generation. We live in the new age of technology, where each of us aspire to achieve one's goal. The purpose of the research is the realization of an educational platform combined with national aspects. The platform which is adjusted  with one of the most efficient approaches of managing online education \cite{song2004improving}. Methods of gathering and processing information, including expert interviews and questionnaires were used in the study. The analysis of the system of online education in our country and abroad provides reasons to assume that the experience, assembled in the field of online learning today, paves the way for the formation of the new  format of distance learning.\cite{khan2011let}
This research outlines the online platform requirements, methods and tools, challenges faced during implementation, and possible future iterations of our course.
