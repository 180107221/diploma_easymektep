\section{Product description}
Easy Mektep is a subject management platform developed by our team in favour of schoolchildren, where schoolchildren can easily organize, complete assigned tasks and track their own progress, control one's time consuming habits. Also, it is a platform, where teachers can create classes and upload assignments for students and check them. In addition, due to the plagiarism checker feature, teachers are able to find cheaters and see overall statistics on children's works' uniqueness(antiplagiarism).  \\
The platform should be slightly styled with national patterns, in order to preserve our national style. 
The site presents a multi-level system for organising the lesson content. The lessons were developed with the use of the task-based learning approach. While completing a task of a certain priority, a student is involved in the active cognitive process. Each task provides a short introductory material and bonus announcement system which helps student to effectively concentrate his knowledge on the task and contributes to successful completion of the task.
